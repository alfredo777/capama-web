    {"p": "Since those early days when Acapulco was only a modest and small fishing village, its inhabitants satisfied their needs for water for domestic use by providing themselves with water from the numerous streams coming down from the hills of the amphitheater and wells dug opencast the yards of most homes, but there were also sources of supply for public use to which they are commonly called springs and among them were those of Palma Sola, La Aguada, Aguas Blancas and El Pozo de la Nacion, recognized since then as the most important. <br/> service distribution and marketing of water was done on donkeys or watercarts they were pulled by gentle and noble horses or wild mules and were measured by cans or jars of clay to sold at the homes where they had already contracted deliveries. Generally, the water used for drinking, were subjected to special filters made of porous stone or clay that traders would bring from distant lands  to sell in the port."},
    {"p": "With the inauguration of the Mexico-Acapulco National Highway in 1927, this area was opened to a new era of splendor and progress, land tourist activity was intensified and increased demands for better hosting services, efficient sewage and a greater amount of drinkable water, it was evident that the infrastructure they had was not up to what would be the new and modernized population center; facing this locals reacted and joined the project proposed the construction of major works."},
    {"p": "That year was the beginning of a period of progressive transformation for Acapulco caused by the land immigration and increased sea traffic of passengers and freight."},
    {"p": "Since most ships that dock in the area  requested that their tanks be filled , the local authorities saw this as an important source of income and immediately hired a company that was responsible for making the corresponding studies on the work that was required, but without clearly specifying the water sources to be used."},
    {"p": "The studies were completed and the technicians determined that the best and certainly the most desirable of the explored springs was the one known by the name of Palma Sola, not only because it was near the port at the base of the hill El Veladero but also because its waters were analyzed in laboratories, and were excellent quality."},
    {"p": "Inaugurated "},
    {"p": "This system was built on the height 195 south of Cerro de Palma Sola, where now the Housing Unit FOVISSSTE is located, supplied water to 50 families who were chosen several years ago to enjoy the home outlets, its production was 15 liters per second in drought season and increased to 200 liters in periods of heavy rain. "},
    {"p": "It is true that 'El Pozo de la Nación' had been the most important source of water of collective use for Acapulco, but actually the first better organized and technically managed system was Palma Sola."},
    {"p": "In 1938 the Guerrero coast was severely hit by a hurrycane, leaving behind extensive and and countless damage to the port infrastructure, which made it clear that it was necessary to modify the old structural forms of construction that was based on the use of adobe earth, mud walls, reeds, wood and palm as prime material to begin to outline gradually new buildings framed within the most advanced architectural techniques. Thus the transformation of the former fishing village gradually turned into the splendid beautiful town; with the rank and reputation that was expected, it began to request urgently to be provided with efficient services to meet the demands of its population as well as national and international tourists which became bigger and diversified ."},
    {"p": "It was then that the federal government realized that it was time to act firmly and decisively applying a policy of total support to programs that had long been approved and included urbanization and modernization of the port. Among the services that were considered priority were those related to water and sewage because the operating system was already insufficient."},
    {"p": "In 1940 Geological and Hidrological investigations were initiated on rainfall in the river basins of Coyuca de Benitez, La Savana and El Papagayo, for the las ten years, in addition to the ones conducted in other areas where water could be getten in sufficient quantity and good quality. When these studies were completed, the commission engineers submitted its opinion, which indicated that the most advisable was to take advantage of the Hamacas river also known as El Chorro, because that flow had sufficient water and excellent quality besides it did not require complicated pumping services to make it reach its destination, because that river is located on the mountains and high above sea level where it would move by gravity allowing incidentally, electricity generation, to continue then to the port of Acapulco. Passing along its journey through the lush foothills of Sierra Madre del Sur."},
    {"p": "When the field work and office projects were completed and the budgets approved by the federal authorities, the corresponding orders were given to the BOARD FOR IMPROVEMENT OF SANITATION AND LIGHTING that was led by President Emilio Portes Gil, to find a reliable company that would be responsible for executing the work. Techo Eterno Eureka,S.A. was the company, which signed the contract through its legal representative Mr. Manuel Suarez and two years later (1942) the work was put into operation."},
    {"p": "In 1946 within presidential term of Miguel Aleman Valdez a decree was issued which created the first FEDERAL BOARD FOR MATERIAL IMPROVEMENT (JFMM) in the country located in Acapulco , appointing as its president Mr. Melchor Perusquía, who with the extensive financial support from the federal government was able to interpret the official policy displaying great activity in the construction of important material works."},
    {"p": "To solve the problem of water, exploration and drilling were initiated in different parts of the region, mainly in Valle de la Sabana, where magnificent underground aquifers able to provide sufficient water not only to meet the needs at the time but there was enough to supply major expenses that may be required in the future."},
    {"p": "In 1950 to advance quickly in the building work, the Board contracted services of people specialized in hidraulics starting the first 7 drilling shallow wells, on the right bank of the Rio se la Sabana Naming the area CAMPO DE POZOS DE AGUA POTABLE.. The system was maintained until 1953 when v the Board undertook the drilling of 3 more wells, one of which was for the exclusive service to the town of Sabana; this whole set of wells was called HYDRAULIC SYSTEM OF HIGH SABANA RIVER which was finish and functioning normally until 1960. Since late 1960 and early 1961 in Valle de la Sabana were 16 wells were operating, the average depth of each well was 30 meters, providing a total flow rate of 630 liters per second."},
    {"p": "By 1969 the population of Acapulco had increased up to 174,800 inhabitants , only emigrations were hasty and haphazard human settlements were located in an anarchic mainly the area of the amphitheater , which led to problems should arise all kinds , mainly related to drinking water , drainage and rainwater at the three levels of government felt it was urgent to order the relocation of these settlements . Surprisingly municipal authorities , with the help of the security forces began the evacuation of large human contingent moving to the Valley of the sheet to form the Emiliano Zapata."},
    {"p": "Since some time to the hydraulic technician and the same authorities had concluded studies , thinking that the only way to resolve the future of serious Acapulco using the waters of the Papagayo River , the interest of the Federal Government was consolidated by a project of this nature."},
    {"p": "The corresponding studies for this purpose technicians did the Secretary of Water Resources , contemplated the possibility of a type Ranney Well with a total yield of 300 liters per second and 12 shallow wells ; these 12 wells would provide an approximate cost of 500 liters per second but with 3 other wells to be built more then you would get a total production of 1.000 liters per second. Such works were projected how are you well built denominándosele PAPAGAYO SYSTEM I. With the construction of the works that would serve to improve the system of water supply and sewerage , Acapulco transform and accelerate their growth becoming the first tourist port of Mexico , with a important international projection ."},
    {"p": "In 1972 , the drinking water and sewerage were divested , creating an administrative board of Water and Sewerage ( JAAPA ) , in order to decentralize the services of the federal government and greater citizen participation by users."},
    {"p": "Although the federal government does not abandon its commitment to support the solution of the problem of drinking water to the port of Acapulco, during the years between 1970 and 1974 the administering body of Drinking Water and Sewerage could barely give medium service and deal with the steady growth of the city."},
    {"p": "In 1975 the Ministry of Water Resources conducted the necessary studies to determine the feasibility of building a new collection on the right bank of the Papagayo River and to determine the work to be done and the approximate cost , after an analysis of the alternatives obtained proposed as a solution more suitable for the collection, building a direct collection work or intake on the right bank of the Papagayo River at a distance of one kilometer downstream of Papagayo I System , denominating pickup unit PAPAGAYO II ."},
    {"p": "In 1977 , the Committee on Water Supply and Sewerage in the Municipality of Acapulco ( CAPAMA ) as a parastatal of the State Public Administration is created."},
    {"p": "In 1989 , is created by operation of law , the Commission on Urban Water Supply and works of social interest of the Municipality of Acapulco ( CAPOUISMA ) , the entity becomes Municipal Public Authority ."},
    {"p": "The April 29, 1994 , by new amendments to the Law , takes the name of CAPAMA , as an autonomous body Prosecutor . <br/> In September 2013 , it starts the System Lomas de Chapultepec , working at 60 % capacity , inaugurated on April 4 working 100 %. This third acquisition on the Papagayo River flow increases to 1,200 lps in Acapulco ."}
